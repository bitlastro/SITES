        <h1>HOW IT WILL WORK</h1>
        <p class="p1">THE TOKEN WILL HAVE 0% FEES UNTIL THE TOTAL SUPPLY IS DISTRIBUTED. IN THE FUTURE, TRANSACTIONS OUTSIDE DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGES OR TRANSFERS BETWEEN EXCHANGES WILL HAVE A FEE RANGING FROM 0.1% TO 1.5%, USED FOR CONVERSION INTO REAL BITCOIN, ENSURING THAT THE TOKEN IS BACKED BY BITCOIN.</p>
        <p class="p2">EXAMPLE:

WHEN A PERSON TRANSFERS 10,000 BITL TO ANOTHER PERSON ON A DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE, A 1% FEE (100 BITL) IS APPLIED. THE RECEIVER GETS 9,900 BITL, WHILE THE COMPANY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TOKEN RESERVES 100 BITL FROM THE TRANSACTION FEE.

THESE 100 BITL ARE AUTOMATICALLY CONVERTED INTO REAL BITCOIN. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE CONVERSION RATE IS 100 BITL = 0.05 BTC, THIS BITCOIN IS STORED IN A CUMULATIVE WALLET AND DISTRIBUTED AMONG 25 BILLION TOKENS.

IN THE FUTURE, AN INTEGRATED EXCHANGE WILL ALLOW BITL HOLDERS TO REDEEM REAL BITCOIN. THIS ENSURES THAT THE TOKEN ALWAYS HAS A REAL BITCOIN-BACKED VALUE, PROVIDING A STRONG MARKET PRICE. </p>
        <p class="p3">üîÑ STABILIZATION MECHANISM:
IF THE MARKET PRICE OF THE TOKEN FALLS BELOW ITS BITCOIN-BACKED VALUE, THE PLATFORM WILL ALLOW TOKEN-TO-BITCOIN EXCHANGES. THIS ENSURES THAT THE TOKEN MAINTAINS A FAIR AND SUSTAINABLE VALUE. </p>

        <h1>SAFE PROJECT</h1>
        <P CLASS="p3">üîê GUARANTEED SECURITY & TRANSPARENCY!

‚úÖ ANTI-HACK PROTECTION ‚Äì THE SECURITY PROTOCOL IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT ANY TYPE OF HACKING OR UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATIONS.

‚öñÔ∏è IMMUTABLE TRANSACTION FEE ‚Äì THE TRANSACTION FEE CAN NEVER EXCEED 1.5%, ENSURING TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS FOR ALL USERS.

üíé BITCOIN-BACKED RESERVE WITH MAXIMUM SECURITY ‚Äì THE RESERVED BITCOINS WILL BE PROTECTED AND REGULATED IN A STABLE COUNTRY, ENSURING THEY CAN ONLY BE EXCHANGED FOR BITL. NO ONE WILL HAVE ACCESS OR CONTROL OVER THESE FUNDS, GUARANTEEING THAT THE TOKEN‚ÄôS BACKING REMAINS SECURE AND UNTOUCHABLE.

 </P>
        <h1>THE FUTURE OF BITL</h1>
        <p class="p1">    üîπ A SUSTAINABLE AND REVOLUTIONARY ECONOMY!
üöÄ FULL TRANSPARENCY: HOW FEES ARE USED

‚úÖ 90% ‚Äì ALLOCATED TO BITCOIN BACKING, ENSURING REAL VALUE FOR THE TOKEN.
üíé 5% ‚Äì DEDICATED TO STAKING REWARDS, REWARDING HOLDERS WHO LOCK THEIR BITL.
üè¢ 3% ‚Äì USED FOR COMPANY DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WILL MANAGE THE BACKING AND BECOME A GLOBAL STOCK EXCHANGE.
üåç TRADE GLOBAL STOCKS WITH BITL! ‚Äì BUY REAL COMPANY SHARES AND EARN DIVIDENDS USING YOUR TOKENS.
üî¨ 2% ‚Äì INVESTED IN FUTURE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEXT-GEN SECURE BLOCKCHAIN FOR THE QUANTUM COMPUTING ERA.
üõ†Ô∏è BITL WILL MIGRATE TO AN ULTRA-SECURE NETWORK IN THE FUTURE!

üî• THE FINANCIAL REVOLUTION STARTS NOW! üî•
