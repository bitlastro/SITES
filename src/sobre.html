        <h1>HOW IT WILL WORK</h1>
        <p class="p1">THE TOKEN WILL HAVE 0% FEES UNTIL THE TOTAL SUPPLY IS DISTRIBUTED. IN THE FUTURE, TRANSACTIONS OUTSIDE DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGES OR TRANSFERS BETWEEN EXCHANGES WILL HAVE A FEE RANGING FROM 0.1% TO 1.5%, USED FOR CONVERSION INTO REAL BITCOIN, ENSURING THAT THE TOKEN IS BACKED BY BITCOIN.</p>
        <p class="p2">EXAMPLE:

WHEN A PERSON TRANSFERS 10,000 BITL TO ANOTHER PERSON ON A DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE, A 1% FEE (100 BITL) IS APPLIED. THE RECEIVER GETS 9,900 BITL, WHILE THE COMPANY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TOKEN RESERVES 100 BITL FROM THE TRANSACTION FEE.

THESE 100 BITL ARE AUTOMATICALLY CONVERTED INTO REAL BITCOIN. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE CONVERSION RATE IS 100 BITL = 0.05 BTC, THIS BITCOIN IS STORED IN A CUMULATIVE WALLET AND DISTRIBUTED AMONG 25 BILLION TOKENS.

IN THE FUTURE, AN INTEGRATED EXCHANGE WILL ALLOW BITL HOLDERS TO REDEEM REAL BITCOIN. THIS ENSURES THAT THE TOKEN ALWAYS HAS A REAL BITCOIN-BACKED VALUE, PROVIDING A STRONG MARKET PRICE. </p>
        <p class="p3">ðŸ”„ STABILIZATION MECHANISM:
IF THE MARKET PRICE OF THE TOKEN FALLS BELOW ITS BITCOIN-BACKED VALUE, THE PLATFORM WILL ALLOW TOKEN-TO-BITCOIN EXCHANGES. THIS ENSURES THAT THE TOKEN MAINTAINS A FAIR AND SUSTAINABLE VALUE. </p>
